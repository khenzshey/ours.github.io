            My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
            Everyone looked worse in the light
            There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
            I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
            Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
            And so I became the butt of the joke
            I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
            Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
            Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
            Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
            Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
            It's brighter now, now
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            And I can still see it all (In my mind)
            All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
            I once believed love would be (Black and white)
            But it's golden (Golden)
            And I can still see it all (In my head)
            Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
            I once believed love would be (Burning red)
            But it's golden
            Like daylight, like daylight
            Like daylight, daylight
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            Like daylight
            It's golden like daylight
            You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
            Just let it go, let it go
            I wanna be defined by the things that I love
            Not the things I hate
            Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
            Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
            I, I just think that
            You are what you love
            I said, "Remember this moment"
            In the back of my mind
            The time we stood with our shaking hands
            The crowds in stands went wild
            We were the kings and the queens
            And they read off our names
            The night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same
            You held your head like a hero
            On a history book page
            It was the end of a decade
            But the start of an age
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            I said, "Remember this feeling"
            I passed the pictures around
            Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
            Wishing for right now
            We are the kings and the queens
            You traded your baseball cap for a crown
            When they gave us our trophies
            And we held them up for our town
            And the cynics were outraged
            Screaming, "This is absurd"
            'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
            Got to rule the world
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
            I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            Hold on to spinning around
            Confetti falls to the ground
            May these memories break our fall
            Will you take a moment?
            Promise me this
            That you'll stand by me forever
            But if, God forbid, fate should step in
            And force us into a goodbye
            If you have children some day
            When they point to the pictures
            Please, tell 'em my name
            Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
            Tell 'em how I hope they shine
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            I had the time of my life, with you
            Long, long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
            And long, long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders
            One day
            We will be remembered

            Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
            And long, long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders
            One day
            We will be remembered
            My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
            Everyone looked worse in the light
            There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
            I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
            Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
            And so I became the butt of the joke
            I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
            Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
            Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
            Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
            Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
            It's brighter now, now
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            And I can still see it all (In my mind)
            All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
            I once believed love would be (Black and white)
            But it's golden (Golden)
            And I can still see it all (In my head)
            Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
            I once believed love would be (Burning red)
            But it's golden
            Like daylight, like daylight
            Like daylight, daylight
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            Like daylight
            It's golden like daylight
            You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
            Just let it go, let it go
            I wanna be defined by the things that I love
            Not the things I hate
            Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
            Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
            I, I just think that
            You are what you love
            I said, "Remember this moment"
            In the back of my mind
            The time we stood with our shaking hands
            The crowds in stands went wild
            We were the kings and the queens
            And they read off our names
            The night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same
            You held your head like a hero
            On a history book page
            It was the end of a decade
            But the start of an age
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            I said, "Remember this feeling"
            I passed the pictures around
            Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
            Wishing for right now
            We are the kings and the queens
            You traded your baseball cap for a crown
            When they gave us our trophies
            And we held them up for our town
            And the cynics were outraged
            Screaming, "This is absurd"
            'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
            Got to rule the world
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
            I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            Hold on to spinning around
            Confetti falls to the ground
            May these memories break our fall
            Will you take a moment?
            Promise me this
            That you'll stand by me forever
            But if, God forbid, fate should step in
            And force us into a goodbye
            If you have children some day
            When they point to the pictures
            Please, tell 'em my name
            Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
            Tell 'em how I hope they shine
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            I had the time of my life, with you
            Long, long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made

            And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
            And long, long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders
            One day
            We will be remembered
            My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
            Everyone looked worse in the light
            There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
            I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
            Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
            And so I became the butt of the joke
            I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
            Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
            Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
            Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
            Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
            It's brighter now, now
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            And I can still see it all (In my mind)
            All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
            I once believed love would be (Black and white)
            But it's golden (Golden)
            And I can still see it all (In my head)
            Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
            I once believed love would be (Burning red)
            But it's golden
            Like daylight, like daylight
            Like daylight, daylight
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            Like daylight
            It's golden like daylight
            You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
            Just let it go, let it go
            I wanna be defined by the things that I love
            Not the things I hate
            Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
            Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
            I, I just think that
            You are what you love
            I said, "Remember this moment"
            In the back of my mind
            The time we stood with our shaking hands
            The crowds in stands went wild
            We were the kings and the queens
            And they read off our names
            The night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same
            You held your head like a hero
            On a history book page
            It was the end of a decade
            But the start of an age
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            I said, "Remember this feeling"
            I passed the pictures around
            Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
            Wishing for right now
            We are the kings and the queens
            You traded your baseball cap for a crown
            When they gave us our trophies
            And we held them up for our town
            And the cynics were outraged
            Screaming, "This is absurd"
            'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
            Got to rule the world
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
            I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            One day, we will be remembered
            Hold on to spinning around
            Confetti falls to the ground
            May these memories break our fall
            Will you take a moment?
            Promise me this
            That you'll stand by me forever
            But if, God forbid, fate should step in
            And force us into a goodbye
            If you have children some day
            When they point to the pictures
            Please, tell 'em my name
            Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
            Tell 'em how I hope they shine
            Long live the walls we crashed through
            I had the time of my life, with you
            Long, long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made

            I had the time of my life, with you
            Long, long live the walls we crashed through
            How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
            And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
            And bring on all the pretenders"
            I'm not afraid
            Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved
            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
            And long, long live that look on your face
            And bring on all the pretenders
            One day
            We will be remembered
        </p>
